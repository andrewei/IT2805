            <h3>Purpose and Goals</h3>
            <p>
                The goal of the page is for anyone and everyone interested in the game series to not only get information on Smash Trondheim but also the games, 
                both general and competitively. It will also serve as place where people interested in the game or the organisation could go to get information 
                or get pointers to where they could go next to learn more.<br />
                Almost all pages will include external links or bring in information from 
                other websites. It will also feature a page which would only consist of links to different pages and sites that Smash Trondheim is either a part 
				of or involved with.<br />
				Further there will also be a page listing recent and upcoming events with concise information and relevant external links.
            </p>
            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>
                The main demographic are the people most likely interested in the game series, both people with an existing interest and people who wants to find 
                more of it. The demographic that most of the time appear on our tournaments, is currently young, male adults. This is the demographic which most often turn up
                for events and also are the most active participants in the group as a whole.<br />
                Nonetheless, this site should be made with every interested party in mind. This entails that the main demographic may not become a factor which would change 
                the design into something which would create an uncomfortable feeling for anyone new and interested.
            </p>

		<h2> 4. Navigation Structure </h2>
			All pages link to all main pages on the website.

			The maximum number of clicks required to get from one place on the website to another is two. You can get to the relevant main page
			from anywhere on the site, and from it is at most one click to get to the desired subpage.
