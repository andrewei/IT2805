            <h3>Purpose and Goals</h3>
            <p>
                The goal of the page is for anyone and everyone interested in the game series to not only get information on Smash Trondheim but also the games, 
                both general and competitively. It would also serve as place where people interested in the game or the organisation could go to get information 
                or get pointers to where they could go next to learn more.<br />
                The website serves as a place where people can go to other sites for information. Almost all pages will either link or bring in information from 
                other websites. It would also feature a page which would only consist of links to different pages and sites that Smash Trondheim is either a part 
                of or involved with.
            </p>
            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>
                The main demographic are the people most likely interested in the game series, both people with an existing interest and people who wants to find 
                more of it. The demographic that most of the time appear on our tournaments, is currently young, male adults. This is the demographic which most often turn up
                for events and also are the most active participants in the group as a whole.<br />
                Nonetheless, this site is made with everyone interested in mind. This entails that the main demographic may not become a factor which would change 
                the design into something which would create an uncomfortable feeling for anyone new and interested.

		<h2> 5. Page Layout and Appearance </h2>
		
		     <p></p>

			 Her var det orginalt et bilde.


			<p>The specific styling for the website that will apply to all pages can be found below: </p>
			<ul>
			    <li>Font: “Flamenco” for the main title (35pt) and navigation bar (20pt), and 
			        “Alegreya Sans” for the body (13pt) </li>
				<li>Color Scheme
				<ul>
				<li>Text: Black</li>
				<li>Background: off-white rgb(250, 248, 236) </li>
				<li>Links: orange rgb(243, 138, 121) </li>
				<li>Shadows: pictures of art will be displayed with a gray shadow at on-load, 
				and darker, black shadows when hovered.</li>
				<li>Borders of the tabs: transparency 50% for each of the following colors 
				 in order from left to right: rgb(254,171,114), rgb(245, 207,101), 
				 rgb(249, 217, 70), rgb(188, 214,237), rgb(176, 171, 216).</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			<li>Body width: 960px; </li>
			<li>Links: The main title “Nan Nan Art Studio” will be a clickable link which
			    will bring users back to the home page. The menu sections will have drop-down
			    menus that can be clicked and contain links to the respective pages. </li>
			<li>Navbar position and its appearance: The navbar will be included
			    at the top of the page. When the mouse hovers over the tabs within the 
			    menu bar, the figurines will appear above the particular tab.
			    When the mouse is on a certain tab, the background of the link will turn to a darker
			    shade of its tab. Hence, the background colors will be, from left to right: 
			    rgb(241,121,70), rgb(250, 124,114), rgb(187, 213, 144), rgb(171, 227,237), 
			    rgb(166, 141,186).</li>
			<li>Banner: The banner will be "Nan Nan Art Studio" written in Flamenco, as seen
			    at the top of the mock-up picture.</li>
			<li>Footer 1: nanmyanmar@gmail.com | Address</li>
			<li>Background Images: We will use a parchment paper texture provided in Microsoft
			    Office Word, which we will make into a jpeg file.</li>
			<li>Border Images: We will use a tree bark texture also provided on Microsoft Office Word. </li>
			<li>Logo: Our logo will be located on the upper left corner of the page next to the
			    banner and the menu tabs. The word “Atutu” will be surrounded by figurines holding hands, 
			    a logo Nan Nan and Jennifer Henbest have requested.</li>
            </ul>

		<h2> 6. Content </h2>
		
		<p>There will be X separate pages as follows:</p>
      

	     <ol>
	        <li>
	            <span class="title">Main</span>
	            <p class="content">
	                This page is the first page the user sees. The main function of this page is to introduce Smash Trondheim and what they do.<br />
	                There should also be a youtube-video of the Smash 4 Wii U intro sequence that is playable.
	            </p>
	        </li>
	        <li>
	            <span class="title">Events and Results</span>
	            <ol>
	                <li>Current Events(default mainpage)</li>
	                <li>Previous Events</li>
	            </ol>
	            <p class="content">
	                Both pages should have certain things in common and small things may be separate.<br />
	                Both pages should have a link to the other page, so there is a possibility of moving back and forth.<br />
	                Both pages should use the same table type, where the first column is the name of the event with a link to the Facebook event. 
	                Second column should be the date of the event. The last, third, column shall be a navigation bar where there are clickable pictures 
	                set up as links to their respective tournament brackets.<br />
	                In Current events, there should be information on S@NG, the weekly event, and when it is NOT happening. In addition, there should
	                not be more than 5 events in current events at any given time, with past and future combined.<br />
	                Previous events is a list of all events no longer in current events. The list is going to be reset every new semester.
	            </p>
	        </li>
	        <li>

	            </ol>
	            <p class="content">
	                The content on the main page is mainly the explanation why we play the games that we do. Another point is also to explain why we 
	                dont play the other games in the series.<br />
	                For every other page, there should be information about the game, the game competitively, activity in Smash Trondheim 
	                and also a youtube-video of the intro for the game (PM should use latest release video). Links to Wikipedia or other sites should 
	                also be present.
	            </p>

	            <p class="content">
	                This page is to be a place for links. These links may take you to a community for a specific game or even the series in general.
	                There is several sites which may be put here (e.g. Facebook, Twitch, Challonge, Youtube) and there may even be multiple 
	                pages in each of these sites.
	            </p>

	                This is the place where the board members of Smash Trondheim will have their name and e-mail address. 
	                This is intended to contact the group and ask questions or ask for events.
	                In addition it is desireable to make a form where the user may send info from the website to one of the provided mail-addresses.
