		<h2> 3. Purpose, goals and audience </h2>	
		
            <h3>Purpose and Goals</h3>
            <p>
                The goal of the website is for anyone and everyone interested in the Smash game series to not only get information about the Smash Trondheim community but also the games, 
                both general and competitively. It will also serve as a place where people interested in the game or the organisation can go to get information 
                or get pointers to where they could go next to learn more.<br />
                Almost all pages will include external links or bring in information from 
                other websites. It will also feature a page which consists of links to different pages and sites that Smash Trondheim is either a part 
				of or involved with.<br />
				Furthermore, there will also be a page listing recent and upcoming events with concise information and relevant external links. The website should have the same style on each page and it should be easy to navigate.
            </p>
            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>
                The main demographic are the people most likely interested in the game series; people with an existing interest and people who wish to learn more. 
				The majority of our demographic consists of young, male adults. This is the demographic which most often turn up
                for events and also are the most active participants in the group as a whole.<br />
                Nonetheless, this site should be made with every interested party in mind. This entails that the main demographic may not become a factor which would change 
                the design into something which would create an uncomfortable feeling for anyone new and interested.
                Therefore, we want to keep the website simple and easy to use for everyone. Gaming websites have a tendency to run darker colors on their websites, and we have consciously decided to choose a similar color palette.
            </p>

		<h2> 4. Navigation Structure </h2>
			All pages link to all main pages on the website.
			In each main page/category on the website, you will find links to all the sub-pages under that respective page/category.
			The maximum number of clicks required to get from one place on the website to another is two. You can get to the relevant main page from anywhere on the site, and from it is at most one click to get to the desired sub-page.

	</section>

	     <ol>
	        <li>
	            <span class="title">Main</span>
	            <p class="content">
	                This page is the first page the user sees. The main function of this page is to introduce Smash Trondheim and what they do.<br />

	            </p>
	        </li>

	            </ol>
	            <p class="content">
	                Both pages will have a link to the other page, so there is a possibility of moving back and forth.<br />
	                Both pages will use the same table type, where the first row is the name of the event with a link to the Facebook event. 
	                Third row will be the date of the event. The last, fourth, row will be a navigation bar with a clickable picture 
	                linking to the respective tournament bracket.<br />
	                In Current Events, there should be information on S@NG, the weekly event, and information about both when and when it is not happening.
					In addition, there should not be more than 5 events in current events at any given time, with past and future combined.<br />
	                Previous events is a list of all events no longer in current events. The list is going to be reset every new semester.

	                and also a Youtube-video of the intro for the game (PM should use latest release video). Links to Wikipedia or other informational sites will
