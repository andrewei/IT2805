            <h3>Purpose and Goals</h3>
            <p>
                The goal of the page is for anyone and everyone interested in the game series to not only get information on Smash Trondheim but also the games, 
                both general and competitively. It will also serve as place where people interested in the game or the organisation could go to get information 
                or get pointers to where they could go next to learn more.<br />
                Almost all pages will include external links or bring in information from 
                other websites. It will also feature a page which would only consist of links to different pages and sites that Smash Trondheim is either a part 
				of or involved with.<br />
				Further there will also be a page listing recent and upcoming events with concise information and relevant external links.
            </p>
            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>
                The main demographic are the people most likely interested in the game series, both people with an existing interest and people who wants to find 
                more of it. The demographic that most of the time appear on our tournaments, is currently young, male adults. This is the demographic which most often turn up
                for events and also are the most active participants in the group as a whole.<br />
                Nonetheless, this site should be made with every interested party in mind. This entails that the main demographic may not become a factor which would change 
                the design into something which would create an uncomfortable feeling for anyone new and interested.
            </p>

	            <span class="title">Main</span>
	            <p class="content">
	                This page is the first page the user sees. The main function of this page is to introduce Smash Trondheim and what they do.<br />
	                There should also be a youtube-video of the Smash for Wii U intro sequence that is playable.
	            </p>
	        </li>
	        <li>

	            </ol>
	            <p class="content">
	                Both pages should have certain things in common and small things may be separate.<br />
	                Both pages should have a link to the other page, so there is a possibility of moving back and forth.<br />
	                Both pages should use the same table type, where the first column is the name of the event with a link to the Facebook event. 
	                Second column should be the date of the event. The last, third, column shall be a navigation bar where there are clickable pictures 
	                set up as links to their respective tournament brackets.<br />
	                In Current events, there should be information on S@NG, the weekly event, and when it is NOT happening. In addition, there should
	                not be more than 5 events in current events at any given time, with past and future combined.<br />
	                Previous events is a list of all events no longer in current events. The list is going to be reset every new semester.

	                The content on the main page is mainly the explanation why we play the games that we do. Another point is also to explain why we

	                For every other page, there should be information about the game, the game competitively, activity in Smash Trondheim 
	                and also a youtube-video of the intro for the game (PM should use latest release video). Links to Wikipedia or other sites should 
	                also be present.
