		<h2> 3. Purpose, goals and audience </h2>
		
      <p>The website’s purpose is to spread global awareness of Nan Nan’s life and artwork 
	  and to inspire people from abroad to help her. Thus, our goal is to inform and intrigue 
	  users about Nan Nan and the wonderful work that she does, as well as to provide users 
	  with volunteer and donation opportunities. The website’s main audience will be those who 
	  are interested in Nan Nan’s life and artwork, such as people who would be interested in 
	  looking through Nan Nan’s gallery for inspiration and pleasure, art teachers and students 
	  who would like to learn about a foreign artist and Myanmar art, as well as potential donors 
	  and volunteers who would like to get explicit information about the ways in which they could 
	  help.

		<h2> 4. Navigation Structure </h2>
		
			<p> The navigation structure of Nan Nan's website can be described as
			clique, and it is shown in Figure 1. From the homepage, it is possible to access
			 all of the pages included in the website, and vice versa, it is 
			 possible to access the homepage from every page through the use of a 
			 roll-over menu. Though not visible until hovered upon, the links for
			 each web page are included within every page. </p>
			 
			 <p>Our reason for choosing a clique structure is to give the user as
			 much freedom within the website as possible and to make him/her aware
			 of the general structure and content of the website without displaying
			 it all. For example, a user on the artwork_paintings.html page can easily 
			 access sub-pages within other categories such as the atutu_volunteerAndDonate.html 
			 page by accessing the simple roll-over menu. Without immediate access to pages 
			 within each section such as "Atutu Art School," the user may never notice that 
			 "Children's Artwork" or "Donate and Volunteer" exist.</p>

		<h2> 5. Page Layout and Appearance </h2>
		
		     <p>In coming up with the universal design, we especially focused on the goal to 
			 intrigue users about Nan Nan and her work; considering that many new users will 
			 not know Nan Nan, the universal design will be important in developing their first
			 impressions of the website and Nan Nan herself. We have therefore focused on making 
			 the universal design simple and clean, with a focus on the navigation bar which will 
			 have informative tabs which are succinct and easy-to-read. The navigation bar provides 
			 tabs covering the full range of topics and therefore instantly fulfil the needs of 
			 the target audience who will be interested in Nan Nan’s life and artwork; the “Artwork” 
			 tab will be especially useful for those interested in looking through Nan Nan’s gallery, 
			 the “Inspirations” tab for art teachers and students, and the “Atutu Art School” and 
			 “Contact/Support Us” tab for potential donors and volunteers. Finally, Nan Nan requested 
			 that we create a simple, clean look, possibly white with a texture. She also requested 
			 that we include the Atutu Art School logo, which we have included on the upper left hand 
			 corner; we believe that this universal design will fulfil her requests. </p>

		    </figure>
			
			<p>The specific styling for the website that will apply to all pages can be found below: </p>
			<ul>
			    <li>Font: “Flamenco” for the main title (35pt) and navigation bar (20pt), and 
			        “Alegreya Sans” for the body (13pt) </li>
				<li>Color Scheme
				<ul>
				<li>Text: Black</li>
				<li>Background: off-white rgb(250, 248, 236) </li>
				<li>Links: orange rgb(243, 138, 121) </li>
				<li>Shadows: pictures of art will be displayed with a gray shadow at on-load, 
				and darker, black shadows when hovered.</li>
				<li>Borders of the tabs: transparency 50% for each of the following colors 
				 in order from left to right: rgb(254,171,114), rgb(245, 207,101), 
				 rgb(249, 217, 70), rgb(188, 214,237), rgb(176, 171, 216).</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			<li>Body width: 960px; </li>
			<li>Links: The main title “Nan Nan Art Studio” will be a clickable link which
			    will bring users back to the home page. The menu sections will have drop-down
			    menus that can be clicked and contain links to the respective pages. </li>
			<li>Navbar position and its appearance: The navbar will be included
			    at the top of the page. When the mouse hovers over the tabs within the 
			    menu bar, the figurines will appear above the particular tab.
			    When the mouse is on a certain tab, the background of the link will turn to a darker
			    shade of its tab. Hence, the background colors will be, from left to right: 
			    rgb(241,121,70), rgb(250, 124,114), rgb(187, 213, 144), rgb(171, 227,237), 
			    rgb(166, 141,186).</li>
			<li>Banner: The banner will be "Nan Nan Art Studio" written in Flamenco, as seen
			    at the top of the mock-up picture.</li>
			<li>Footer 1: nanmyanmar@gmail.com | Address</li>
			<li>Background Images: We will use a parchment paper texture provided in Microsoft
			    Office Word, which we will make into a jpeg file.</li>
			<li>Border Images: We will use a tree bark texture also provided on Microsoft Office Word. </li>
			<li>Logo: Our logo will be located on the upper left corner of the page next to the
			    banner and the menu tabs. The word “Atutu” will be surrounded by figurines holding hands, 
			    a logo Nan Nan and Jennifer Henbest have requested.</li>
            </ul>

		<h2> 6. Content </h2>
		
		<p>There will be nine separate pages as follows:</p>
      <ol>
		<li>Homepage-<em>homepage.html</em> 
           <p>The homepage will be the first page that will appear when users visit the website. 
		   Although the homepage will not include any content, a larger image will appear and give 
		   users a preview of the content of Nan Nan’s website.</p> 
           <p>The homepage will fulfil the goal of intriguing users about Nan Nan. Consistent with 
		   the universal designs of this website, we will therefore create a homepage that is simple 
		   and will encourage users to further explore the website. Because too much text will overwhelm
		   the audience, we decided to include just one large image that we hope will grab the user’s 
		   attention. By keeping the text to a minimum, we will also be able to prompt users to the 
		   navigation bar.</p> 
           <p>Through the use of Javascript, images will be randomly presented on the homepage. Each 
		   image will have a height of 400px and will be centered in the body.</p> 
		   <figure>
		      <img src="./P2 Design Guidelines_files/homepage.jpg" alt="mockup for homepage" width="550">
			  <figcaption>Figure 3: Mockup for homepage.html</figcaption>
		   </figure>
		   
		</li><li>About-<em>about.html</em>
           <p>The “About” page will provide a brief biography about Nan Nan and the work that she does.</p> 
           <p>This page will help us achieve the goal of informing users about Nan Nan’s life. Similar 
		   to the homepage and universal design, the “About” page will provide art teachers, students, 
		   and potential donors and volunteers with one of their first impressions of Nan Nan. Thus, 
		   we will continue to emphasize simplicity through a clean layout that will include one portrait 
		   of Nan Nan in the upper right-hand corner.</p>  
           <p>The image of Nan Nan will be floated to the right, and text will wrap around the image. The 
		   image will be 250px by 250px with rounded borders. We will make sure to reduce the image size to 
		   less than 100kB to prevent a slow-loading web page.</p>

			  <figcaption>Figure 4: Mockup for about.html</figcaption>
		   </figure>
 
        </li><li>Inspirations-<em>inspirations.html</em>
		    <p>The “Inspirations” web page will include information about Nan Nan’s work and how this has 
			been influenced by Myanmar’s art and culture.</p>
            <p>This page will fulfil the goal of further informing users about Nan Nan’s artwork as well as 
			Myanmar’s contemporary art forms and culture in general. It will serve the needs of those such 
			as students who will further their understanding about a foreign artist and Myanmar’s unique art form. 
			We will fulfil this goal by making the web page especially informative and educational, through 
			the use of pictures showing the location of Myanmar and unique materials used in Myanmar art.</p> 
            <p>Images with a height and width of 200px will be floated to the right or the left throughout the page.</p> 
           <figure>

		   </figure>
		   
        </li><li>Artwork "Paintings"-<em>artwork_paintings.html</em>
		   <p>This section will be one of two pages showing Nan Nan’s artwork, and will include about 
		   thirty pictures of her artwork. This page will specifically focus on her paintings. </p>
		   <p>This page will fulfil the goal of informing and intriguing users about Nan Nan’s artwork. In order to 
		   allow users to fully appreciate each piece of art, we will make the layout one that is simple, with a 
		   solid white background which will prevent unnecessary colors from detracting from the power of her artwork. 
		   In order to help users focus on each artwork, the shadow color will get darker when users hover over the 
		   image, providing even more emphasis on what the user is viewing. </p>
		   <p>Each image will have a height and width of 150px. In order to ensure that the pages load quickly, we 
		   will make sure to make each image size smaller than 100kB. Each black-bordered box will have a height and 
		   width of 200px with 50px margins and paddings. The shadows will be gray but will turn to black when hovered. 
		   When the image is clicked, the image will be enlarged 250%. The new black-bordered box will have a height 
		   of 350px and width of 450px. The white color of the background images will also be turned into a black color 
		   with 50% transparency. </p>

		   </figure>
		   
	    </li><li>Artwork "Design"-<em>artwork_design.html</em>
		   <p>This section is identical to the previous page, with the exception that it will focus on pictures of Nan Nan’s 
		   designs instead of her paintings. The goals and mockups are identical as well, with the exception of the 
		   heading which will be changed to “Design.”</p>
		   
		</li><li>Atutu Art School "About"-<em>atutu_aboutTheSchool.html</em>
		   <p>This page will be one of three pages under the “Atutu Art School” section. It will be called “About” and 
		   include information about the school philosophy, motto and class offerings.</p>
		   <p>This page will fulfil the goal of informing and intriguing users about Nan Nan’s life dedicated to art 
		   and education. In order to provide both an informative, yet intriguing web page, we will balance out the 
		   content with some images that will be visually-compelling. For example, along with the content, we will 
		   also include images of the school, the logo of the school, and a picture of the course offerings. </p>
		   <p>Two images with a 200px width and a 150px length will appear at the top of the page, alongside the 
		   logo of Atutu Art School with a 150px width and a 100 px length. The images will be centered on one line. The class 
		   offerings will be included in a chart, with width and length of 600 px. </p>

		   </figure>
		
		</li><li>Atutu Art School "Children's Artwork"-<em>atutu_childrenArtwork.html</em>
		   <p>This page will be the second page under the “Atutu Art School” section. It will be called “Children’s 
		   Artwork” and include a gallery of children’s artwork and pictures of them doing art at Atutu Art School. </p>
		   <p>This page will fulfil the goal of informing and intriguing users about Nan Nan’s life dedicated to 
		   the art school. Similar to the artwork pages showing Nan Nan’s paintings and designs, we will fulfil 
		   this goal by displaying the children’s artwork using a very simple, yet dynamic layout as shown in the mockup. 
		   By keeping the layout simple, we hope that each of the art pieces will stand out and allow users to reflect 
		   not only on the wonderful work that the children are doing, but also on Nan Nan’s strong dedication in running 
		   her art school. </p>
		   <p>This section will have the same design format as the two pages in the artwork section, with the exception 
		   of the header which will be changed to “Children’s Artwork.” </p>

		   </figure>
		   
	    </li><li>Atutu Art School "Donate and Volunteer"-<em>atutu_volunteerAndDonate.html</em>
		   <p>The last page part of the “Atutu Art School” pages will be called “Donate and Volunteer.” “Donate and 
		   Volunteer” will include a donation wish list and volunteer application form. </p>
		   <p>This page will fulfil the goal of providing users with practical volunteer and donation information. 
		   In order to encourage users to help out, we plan to make this web page concise and coherent. We will provide 
		   a volunteer form right on this page, which users will instantly be able to fill out to show their interest 
		   in volunteering. The web page will also request donation items in the form of a list, which will be more 
		   visually appealing than a long paragraph. </p>
		   <p>This page will have two columns, each with width of 400px. One will include a unlisted list of donation 
		   request materials. Each column will have a solid orange border, with margin of 50px and padding of 100px. </p>

		   </figure>
		   
        </li><li>Support/Contact Us-<em>supportAndContactUs.html</em>
		   <p>This page will include contact information (email, address, phone number), a map, and a link that will 
		   direct users back to the “Donate and Volunteer” page in “Atutu Art School.” </p>
		   <p>This page will help us fulfil the goal of providing users with the opportunity to take action and stay 
		   connected. In order to make sure that users have an easy time finding information, we will keep this document 
		   simple. No content will be in the form of long paragraphs, and all images will be practically meaningful. 
		   For example, we will include both a map and a picture of Nan Nan’s Art Studio, which will be helpful for 
		   those who plan to go visit her. Finally, we have chosen to include a link to the “Donate and Volunteer” page, 
		   because we suspect that users trying to find such information may come to this web page. In order to make sure 
		   that users do not overlook such information, we believe that giving them the direct link will allow them to 
		   more easily navigate the website.</p>
		   <p>This page will have an image with width of 200px and length of 175px floated to the right. There will 
		   also be a large Google map included, with width of 700px. The link will turn orange when hovered.</p>

		<h2> 7. Minimum Requirements </h2>
		
		
			<p> We plan to fulfil the minimum requirements of Javascript
			 applications in this way: </p>
			 
			 <p> <em>Guttorm and Ellen </em> will be in charge of implementing: </p>
			 
			 <ol>
			 	<li>A Javascript function that will dynamically display artwork in
			 	a random fashion in a slideshow. Since Nan Nan's website is very visual, we would 
			 	like it to be as interactive and appealing as possible. The random 
			 	image display through Javascript will increase user's curiosity and interesty by 
				portraying a variety of different aspects of Nan Nan's artwork, Atutu Art School, 
				and the children.
			 	
			 	</li><li> A Javascript function that allows a pop-up window to display a larger 
			 	version of the thumbnail picture when clicked on. We will have many pictures
			 	of paintings and the school, so in order to decrease loading time and 
			 	not confuse the user, we will use 150px x 150px thumbnails, which the users will
			 	be able to click on to enlarge. The resulting larger picture will be 350px x 450px. 
				We plan to make it similar to Facebook's function for pictures and the blurred gray background.
			 </li></ol>
			 	
			 <p> <em>Trond and Birgit</em> will be in charge of implementing: </p>
			 
			 <ol>
			 	<li>A Javascript function for a roll over menu that will be provided on each
			 	page to allow easy access to every other page in the website. We do not want
			 	every link to appear constantly on the page, hence links of similar topics will
			 	appear under one heading that will hint the user to hover over. For example,
			 	the user can hover upon the "Atutu Art School" tab and the menu will roll down
			 	displaying atutu_aboutTheSchool.html, atutu_ChildrenArtwork.html and 
			 	atutu_volunteerAndDonate.html.
			 	
			 	</li><li>A Javascript that uses loops for arrays to display prices and artwork
			 	respectively. Nan Nan will be selling her artwork to potential customers 
			 	using the web page, so it is important for her to have easy control over 
			 	the price lists and art piece names and other relevant information such as
			 	dimensions and material in one place. 
			</li></ol>
			
			
			<p> As one of the pages include volunteer information, we hope to add a fifth 
			Javascript to display a volunteer form to acquire all the necessary information
			for Nan Nan easily and efficiently.</p>
